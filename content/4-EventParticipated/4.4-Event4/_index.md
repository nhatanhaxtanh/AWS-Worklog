# Event Report: AWS Cloud Mastery Series #2 — DevOps on AWS

## Event Purpose

- Reinforce the DevOps mindset and cultural principles.
- Present AWS services that support CI/CD: CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, CodePipeline.
- Deep-dive into Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with CloudFormation and AWS CDK.
- Explore container services (ECS, EKS, App Runner) and observability tools (CloudWatch, X-Ray).

## Highlights

### Morning: CI/CD Pipeline & Infrastructure as Code (08:30 – 12:00)
- DevOps mindset: emphasize core principles and DORA metrics (Deployment Frequency, MTTR, etc.).
- CI/CD services:
  - Source control: AWS CodeCommit and Git strategies (GitFlow vs. trunk-based).
  - Build & test: AWS CodeBuild.
  - Deployment: AWS CodeDeploy (Blue/Green, Canary, Rolling strategies).
  - Orchestration: automate pipelines with AWS CodePipeline.
- Demo: walkthrough of a full CI/CD pipeline.
- IaC:
  - AWS CloudFormation: templates, stacks, and drift detection.
  - AWS CDK: constructs, reusable patterns, and multi-language support.
- Demo & discussion: deploying with both CloudFormation and CDK; discussion about tool choices.

### Afternoon: Containers, Observability & Best Practices (13:00 – 17:00)
- Container services:
  - Docker: fundamentals of containerization.
  - Amazon ECR: image storage, scanning, and lifecycle management.
  - ECS & EKS: deployment strategies, scaling, orchestration.
  - App Runner: an alternative PaaS for containers.
- Monitoring & observability:
  - AWS CloudWatch: metrics, logs, alarms, dashboards.
  - AWS X-Ray: distributed tracing for microservices.
- Best practices:
  - Feature flags, A/B testing.
  - Incident management and postmortems.
- Demo & case study: comparing deployment strategies for microservices.

## Key Takeaways

- DevOps culture: understand DORA metrics and the automation mindset.
- CI/CD: how AWS Code services integrate; advanced deployment strategies (Blue/Green, Canary).
- IaC: foundational knowledge of CloudFormation and CDK—useful for optimizing templates and multi-stack architectures.
- Observability: the importance of full-stack monitoring with CloudWatch and X-Ray to debug issues (CORS, Lambda, etc.).
- Container services (ECS/EKS) provide guidance for more complex future architectures.
- Practical demos on CI/CD & IaC helped the team see how to optimize deployment workflows.

## Event Experience

- The full-day workshop was detailed and practical, providing applicable knowledge.
- Demos and case studies were helpful for project application.
- Good networking opportunities with the community and experts.
