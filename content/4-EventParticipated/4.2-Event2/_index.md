- Rapid response to potential threats.

#### Case Studies and Practical Lessons

- Directly "dissected" projects from **CMC Global** and **AWS** to learn how businesses apply AI in addressing security and system operations issues.
- Explored how AI helps eliminate rigid "gatekeepers," 24/7 on-call shifts, and costly manual response procedures in DevSecOps.

#### Career Orientation and Professional Development

- Discussed that continuously updating trends and enhancing specialization are the key to engineers conquering complex projects.

### Key Takeaways

#### AI Integration and Automation

- Clearly understood the **Comprehensive AI Integration Solution** in DevSecOps, including process automation and continuous security testing in CI/CD.
- Grasped how AI can enable **intelligent risk prediction** and accelerate threat response.

#### Modern DevSecOps Mindset

- Recognized the importance of **integrating security into the SDLC** (Software Development Life Cycle).
- Understood how popular tools like **Jenkins** (CI/CD), **SonarQube** (SAST), **OWASP ZAP** (DAST), and **Terraform** (IaC) operate.

#### Generative AI Tools

- Explored **Amazon Q Developer** – a powerful generative AI assistant supporting code generation, testing, vulnerability scanning, and software development optimization on AWS.

### Application to Work (From Worklog Week 6)

- **Apply the DevSecOps mindset** to the current project, integrating security from the early development stages.
- **Research Amazon Q Developer** for integration into the workflow to support code generation and security testing.
- Investigate **CI/CD** tools and **SAST/DAST** security testing for inclusion in the project's development roadmap.
